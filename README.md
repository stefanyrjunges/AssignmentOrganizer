<h1>Assignment Organizer with Due Notifications</h1>
<p align="justify">
A Python project written for personal use, aiming to streamline the assignment management process, providing a centralized platform for tracking and
staying updated on upcoming deadlines. By combining intuitive user interface design with automated notifications, the application aims to enhance productivity and reduce
the likelihood of missed deadlines.
</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p align="justify">
The Assignment Organizer with Due Date Notifications is a Python application developed using Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and openpyxl for Excel sheet manipulation.
It serves as a tool for users to manage their assignments efficiently.

The user interface prompts the user to input assignment details such as name, module, and due date, along with a status flag indicating whether the assignment is completed or not.
Upon submission, the data is saved to an Excel file specified by the filepath. If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new Excel workbook with the specified headers and saves the data.
If the file exists, it appends the data to the existing workbook. 

The application also includes a feature for due date notifications, checking the Excel sheet for upcoming due dates. When the current date matches a due date, the application sends a notification to the user's
phone, reminding them of the impending deadline.
